# --list Option Specification

## Overview

The `--list` option displays all PRs in a branch chain as markdown links, making it easy to view and navigate the PR sequence.

## Usage

```bash
gh-propagate --list <base-branch> <target-branch>
```

## Behavior

1. Discovers the PR chain from `<base-branch>` to `<target-branch>` using the existing chain discovery logic
2. Outputs each PR in the chain as a markdown link in the format: `- [n/total] statusIcon #<number>: [<title>](<url>)`
3. PRs are listed in order from base to target branch
4. Includes status icons (ðŸ”„ for open, âœ… for merged PRs)
5. Automatically includes merged PRs in integration mode
6. If no PR chain is found, displays an appropriate message

## Example Output

```markdown
- [1/3] âœ… #123: [Add user authentication](https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123)
- [2/3] ðŸ”„ #124: [Implement login form](https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/124)
- [3/3] ðŸ”„ #125: [Add password reset](https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/125)
```

## Error Handling

- If branch chain cannot be discovered, show error message
- If no PRs found in chain, show "No PRs found in chain" message
- Invalid branch names should show appropriate error

## Implementation Notes

- Reuse existing PR discovery logic from main propagate functionality
- Use `gh pr view --json number,headRefName,baseRefName,url,title,body` to get PR details including title, PR number, and URL
- Format output as clean markdown for easy copying/sharing
- Integration mode automatically includes merged PRs in the chain
- Status icons differentiate between open and merged PRs
